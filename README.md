# RC Car PID Simulation
RC Car PID Simulation in processing and test Arduino code for steering.

- [ ] P5js script that create drive patterns and steers a virtual vehicle around that path using vector math.
- [ ] Create a steering system using the values from IMU and typical RC Car controls
- [ ] Setup a test figure out
- [ ] Drivng along in sketched path
- [ ] Upload images of patsh to drive
- [ ] Manually via mouse position or scroll wheel Drive through a video of data collected from a Foocar
- [ ] Collect data in the same format as used for the training of Foocars
- [ ] Can the data from virtual driving be moved to the real world RC Car?
- [ ] Can real world data help train the virtual vehcicle
- [ ] Virtual Figure out problem
- [ ] Real world figure 8
- [ ] Communcation between real cars
- [ ] Commuinication between virtual cars
